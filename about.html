            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>A perpetual tumbleweed, I am currently based in Berlin. I have a love for writing, video games, any escapist medium, nature, the act of communicating and building relationships virtually and in reality, my dog - Harold, daydreaming, night dreaming, and solving problems.</p>
            <p>Catch me if you can,</p>
            <p>David</p>
